	abstract = {In the petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, supply chains typically consist of multiple stages of production facilities, warehouse/distribution centers, logistical subnetworks and end customers. Supply chain performance in the face of various market and technical uncertainties is usually measured by service level, that is, the expected fraction of demand that the supply chain can satisfy within a predefined allowable delivery time window. Safety stock is introduced into supply chains as an important hedge against uncertainty in order to provide customers with the promised service level. Although a higher safety stock level guarantees a higher service level, it does increase the supply chain operating cost and thus these levels must be suitably optimized.
The complexities in safety stock management for multi-stage supply chain with multiple products and production capacity constraints arise from: (1) the nonlinear performance functions that relate the service level, expected inventory with safety stock control variables at each site; (2) the interdependence of the performances of different sites; and (3) finally the margin by which production capacity exceeds the uncertain demand. Given the complexities, the integrated management of safety stocks across the supply chain imposes significant computational challenges. In this research, we propose an approach in which the evaluation of the performance functions and the decision on safety stock related variables are decomposed into two separate computational frameworks. For evaluating the performance functions, off-line computation using a discrete event simulation model is proposed. A linear programming based safety stock management model is developed, in which the safety stock control variables (the target inventory levels used in production planning and scheduling models, base-stock levels for the base-stock policy at the warehouses) and service levels at both plant stage and warehouse stages are used as important decision variables. In the linear programming model, the nonlinear performance functions, interdependence of the performances, and the safety production capacity limits in safety stock management are properly represented.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safety stock management model, a case study of a realistically scaled polymer supply chain problem is presented. In the case problem, the supply chain is composed of two geographically separated production sites and 3–8 warehouses supplying 10 final products to 30 sales regions.},

	abstract = {In a number of recent papers, the Laplace transform together with input-output analysis has been applied for the sake of formulating a basic theoretical description of material requirements planning ({MRP).}
The transform approach has had a threefold use; on the one hand, it has been useful for describing time developments of the relevant production, demand and inventory properties in a compact way including effects of order flows and lead times. Second, the transform also captures stochastic properties by functioning as a generating function, and, third, the transform is easily applied for assessing the resulting cash flows when adopting the net present value ({NPV)} principle (or the annuity stream principle which is a variation of {NPV).}
Input-output analysis, in particular the input matrix, is applied for describing multi-level product structures, which has made the analysis concise and distinct.
In this paper we extend the analysis of determining optimal safety stock levels for a sequence of planned production decisions (a one-level {MRP} system) by applying the annuity stream as a criterion to a simple model instead of the average cost approach previously used.},

	abstract = {The pressure to reduce inventory investments in supply chains has increased as competition expands and product variety grows. Managers are looking for areas they can improve to reduce inventories without hurting the level of service provided. Two areas that managers focus on are the reduction of the replenishment lead time from suppliers and the variability of this lead time. The normal approximation of lead time demand distribution indicates that both actions reduce inventories for cycle service levels above 50\%. The normal approximation also indicates that reducing lead time variability tends to have a greater impact than reducing lead times, especially when lead time variability is large. We build on the work of Eppen and Martin (1988) to show that the conclusions from the normal approximation are flawed, especially in the range of service levels where most companies operate. We show the existence of a service-level threshold greater than 50\% below which reorder points increase with a decrease in lead time variability. Thus, for a firm operating just below this threshold, reducing lead times decreases reorder points, whereas reducing lead time variability increases reorder points. For firms operating at these service levels, decreasing lead time is the right lever if they want to cut inventories, not reducing lead time variability.},

Consequently, demand forecasting is a critical decision process. Using modular product design and super bills of materials are two effective strategies for developing a reliable demand forecasting process. They reduce the probability of stockouts in diversified production contexts. Furthermore, managing and controlling safety stocks for pre-assembled modules provide an effective solution to the problem of minimizing the effects of forecast errors. This paper develops, evaluates, and applies innovative cost-based analytical models so that the optimal safety stock of modular subassemblies and components in assembly to order and manufacturing to order systems, respectively, can be rapidly quantified. The implementation of the proposed models in two industrial case applications demonstrates that they significantly reduce the safety stock inventory levels and the global logistical cost.},

Previous analyses of production ordering systems have left untouched the variation in the production ordering quantities and inventory at each stage. in spite of the fact that amplification phenomena of these variations are critical in a multi-stage production inventory system. Generally, we are able to classify the multi-stage production ordering systems into two types, i.e, the push-type and the pull-type. This paper discusses the following subjects concerning the push-type and multi-stage production ordering system based on forecasting: (1) the effects of demand fluctuations and forecasted errors on the amplification of production order variation and inventory variations in terms of a basic production ordering model, and (2) the same effect in a modified production ordering model which is able to decrease both the variations in the production ordering quantities and in the inventory at each stage.},

	abstract = {In order to meet increasing customer demands for more diverse product offerings, firms are revising their supply chain structures to accommodate mass customization. The revised structures often involve delaying the delivery of the products until after the customer orders arrive, termed time postponement ({TP)}, or delaying the differentiation of the products until later production stages, termed form postponement ({FP).} We develop models representing possible implementations of the {TP} and {FP} structures and compare their performance in total supply chain cost and expected customer waiting times. We find that once the number of different products increases above some threshold level, the {TP} structure is preferred under both performance metrics.
For the most general model, a numerical experiment was designed to investigate how different factors affect the performance of the {TP} and {FP} structures. Through this experiment we show that higher arrival time and process time variations make the {FP} structure more favorable while increases in the number of products and higher interest rates make the {TP} structure more favorable. We also offer guidance to managers using either structure on where to allocate resources for performance improvement. For example, to improve the customer waiting times under the {FP} structure, increasing the coverage of the generic component and reducing the number of products provide larger benefits than reducing the variability of the arrival and process times.},

As a key feature of {MC}, postponement strategies means postponing activities in the supply chain until customer orders are received. The feasibility and viability of postponement in supply chain has been discussed from a cost minimization perspective, however, this research is based on the assumption that the customization process will take little time so that the customer can accept the extra wait time required by the postponement strategy. Taking customer wait time into consideration, this paper introduces a hybrid postponement strategy (partial postponement), which differs from total postponement in that it allows the stock of both finished goods and generic products. We evaluate three strategies — no postponement, hybrid postponement and total postponement — and analyze the conditions under which one is preferred. Finally, we discuss key factors affecting hybrid postponement in the supply chain.},

Among these, the form postponement ({FP)} strategy is an efficient tool and has been widely adopted. To the supply chain with {FP} strategy, the design mostly involves two problems: determination of customer order decoupling point ({CODP)} position and semi-finished product inventory control. In this paper, we develop a two-stage tandem queueing network with {MAP} arrival to address this issue. Particularly, we introduce a Markov arrival process ({MAP)} to characterize the correlation of the demand. By using of matrix geometric method, we derive several performance measure of the supply chain, such as inventory level and unfill rate. Our numerical examples show that both the variance and the correlation coefficient of the demand lead to more delayed {CODP} position and more total cost.},

The goal of our model (called the stochastic {LMRP}, or {SLMRP)} is to find solutions that minimize the expected total cost (including location, transportation, and inventory costs) of the system across all scenarios. The location model explicitly handles the economies of scale and risk-pooling effects that result from consolidating inventory sites. The {SLMRP} framework can also be used to solve multi-commodity and multi-period problems.
We present a Lagrangian-relaxation–based exact algorithm for the {SLMRP.} The Lagrangian subproblem is a non-linear integer program, but it can be solved by a low-order polynomial algorithm. We discuss simple variable-fixing routines that can drastically reduce the size of the problem. We present quantitative and qualitative computational results on problems with up to 150 nodes and 9 scenarios, describing both algorithm performance and solution behavior as key parameters change.},

	abstract = {This paper constructs and analyzes a multi-location inventory model to examine the value of warehouse risk-pooling in high service-level systems. Specifically, risk-pooling over the outside-supplier leadtime is examined. Two alternative systems of N identical retailers are formulated. In System 1, each retailer operates independently: retailers receive goods directly from an outside supplier after a fixed leadtime (Ls + Ltr), where Ls is the outside supplier's own (e.g., manufacturing) leadtime and Ltr is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the retailers. In System 2, the system order is shipped to a warehouse, arriving after a fixed leadtime (Ls + Ltw), where Ltw is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the warehouse. Upon receipt of the goods, the warehouse allocates and ships units to the retailers to equalize their inventory positions. The warehouse does not hold inventory. Allocation and reshipment in System 2 requires a fixed leadtime of (Lpw + Ltr) time periods, where Lpw is the allocation and (re)packaging leadtime at the warehouse. Hence, System 2 pools risk over the outside supplier leadtime, but at the cost of: (1) increased overall leadtime to the retailers; and (2) an `internal' pipeline inventory holding cost. Our analysis asks the question: given equal required service-levels and equal safety stock holding cost (plus pipeline inventory cost for System 2), how large can System 2's extra leadtimes (Ltw, Lpw) be? Our analysis concludes that pipeline inventory-holding cost significantly influences the overall value of these breakeven leadtimes. Specifically, when pipeline inventory holding costs can (somehow) be ignored, the corresponding breakeven leadtimes can be quite large. However, if these costs cannot be avoided, then the corresponding breakeven leadtimes are significantly reduced. Managerial interpretations are provided.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study a single-depot/multi-retailer system with independent stochastic stationary demands, linear inventory costs, and backlogging at the retailers over an infinite horizon. In addition, we also consider the transportation cost between the depot and the retailers. Orders are placed each period by the depot. The orders arrive at the depot and are allocated and delivered to the retailers. No inventory is held at the depot. We consider a specific policy of direct shipments. That is, a lower bound on the long run average cost per period for the system over all order/delivery strategies is developed. The simulated long term average cost per period of the delivery strategy of direct shipping with fully loaded trucks is examined via comparison to the derived lower bound. Simulation studies demonstrate that very good results can be achieved by a direct shipping policy.},

At every facility in the system orders are placed (or production is initiated) periodically. The order arrives after a fixed lead time. At the end of each period linear costs are incurred penalty costs are incurred at the most downstream facilities for back-orders. The objective is to minimize the expected holding and penalty costs per period. We prove that under the balance assumption it is cost optimal to control every facility by an order-up-to-policy. The optimal replenishment policy, i.e. the order-up-to-level and the allocation functions at each facility, can be determined by system decomposition. This decomposition reduces complex multi-dimensional control problems to simple one-dimensional problems.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of ordering and issuing policies arising in controlling finite-life-time fresh-meat-carcass inventories in supermarkets. A supermarket orders a product, which constitutes a set of sub-products of fixed proportion, from a vendor at the beginning of each time cycle. After it is received from the vendor, the product is stored in the cool-room, before being issued to the display shelves. The sub-products then satisfy random customer demand. After passing the life-time, sub-products are salvaged. In this system, the sub-products are issued to the display shelves according to theorder-up-to level policies at the beginning of every period. The decisions to be taken to solve this problem are the product-ordering quantity from the outside vendor and the order-up-to issuing quantities for each sub-product. The objective function to be maximized is the expected profit per unit time, consisting of revenue from sales and salvage, and the cost of ordering, processing (or issuing), inventory holding, emergency issuing, and shortage. In this paper we first develop a mathematical model describing actual operations and then simplify the sub-product runout period so that optimal ordering and issuing policies are easily established. We then carry out extensive numerical experiments for a case of two sub-products in order to ascertain the properties and the behavior of the optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {This paper examines a two-level distribution system consisting of a central warehouse ({CW)} supplying several branch warehouses ({BW's)}, which, in turn, supply normally-distributed customer demands in a periodic-review environment. The {CW} replenishes system inventory using a base-stock replenishment policy and a predetermined order cycle of H time periods; i.e., every H periods, the {CW} orders enough from an outside supplier to bring the systemwide inventory position to a certain level (to be determined) based on a given minimum level of customer service. Upon receipt of this order, the {CW} allocates it entirely to the {BW's} so as to minimize the expected total units short at the {BW's.} This simple allocation scheme, may, of course, lead to out-of-balance {BW} inventories towards the end of the {CW's} order cycle. Hence, redistribution during the cycle should be considered. The redistribution treated here is a complete redistribution of all {BW} inventories one period before the end of the order cycle. Approximate formulas are derived which allow for a comparison of the system-wide inventories appropriate to each of two allocation schemes: (1) the simple allocation scheme only; and (2) the simple allocation scheme with total redistribution one period before the end of the order cycle. Limited computational tests indicate the magnitude of the improvements possible with total redistribution, and the sensitivities of these improvements to model parameters.},

	abstract = {In this article, we introduce the capacitated warehouse location model with risk pooling ({CLMRP)}, which captures the interdependence between capacity issues and the inventory management at the warehouses. The {CLMRP} models a logistics system in which a single plant ships one type of product to a set of retailers, each with an uncertain demand. Warehouses serve as the direct intermediary between the plant and the retailers for the shipment of the product and also retain safety stock to provide appropriate service levels to the retailers. The {CLMRP} minimizes the sum of the fixed facility location, transportation, and inventory carrying costs. The model simultaneously determines warehouse locations, shipment sizes from the plant to the warehouses, the working inventory, and safety stock levels at the warehouses and the assignment of retailers to the warehouses. The costs at each warehouse exhibit initially economies of scale and then an exponential increase due to the capacity limitations. We show that this problem can be formulated as a nonlinear integer program in which the objective function is neither concave nor convex. A Lagrangian relaxation solution algorithm is proposed. The Lagrangian subproblem is also a nonlinear integer program. An efficient algorithm is developed for the linear relaxation of this subproblem. The Lagrangian relaxation algorithm provides near-optimal solutions with reasonable computational requirements for large problem instances. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We investigate the sensitivity of the cost advantage of inventory pooling to various system parameters, including loading, service levels, demand and production time variability, and structure of the production system. The analysis reveals differences in how various parameters affect the cost reduction from pooling and suggests that these differences stem from the manner in which the parameters influence the induced correlation between lead-time demands of the demand streams. We compare these results with those obtained for pure inventory systems, where lead times are exogenous. We also compare inventory pooling with several forms of capacity pooling.},

When demand is uncertain, it is intuitive and true that a larger “willing to substitute” fraction implies larger expected profits. A higher “willing to substitute” fraction allows one to pool the risk of individual products. It may also be intuitive that a larger “willing to substitute” fraction might result in lower optimal total inventory. For the full substitution structure, several researchers have shown that for certain distributions such as the exponential, this latter intuition is not true. We show that this full substitution anomaly can occur with any right skewed demand distribution. We assume i.i.d. demand distributions unless we indicate otherwise. We also show that the anomaly can occur for a number of realistic situations of partial substitution with commonly used demand distributions such as Normal, exponential, Poisson, and uniform. We also demonstrate the anomaly for more than one period, with backlogging, lost sales, more than two products, and with setup costs.},
